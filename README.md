## How to use

1. clone this repo
2. from within the folder of this repo, run:

`node base.js '<PATH/TO/ARTICLES/FILE/DIRECTORY>' '<PATH/TO/SCRIPT/FILE/DIRECTORY>'`
The first argument should be the absolute path to where the articles are located, e.g. `'/Users/username/Desktop/Articles'.`\
The second argument should be the absolute path to where this script is located, e.g.`'Users/username/Desktop/sp_proj'`\
Both arguments MUST be given as strings, or else the script will throw an error.
